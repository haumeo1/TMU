/**
 * The below class defines an Automobile object. Automobiles have a certain fuel
 * efficiency (measured in km/liters) and a certain amount of fuel in the gas
 * tank measured in liters.
 * <p>
 * Complete the Automobile class as follows:
 * <p>
 * - The efficiency should be initialized in the constructor via a parameter
 * - The initial fuel level should be set to 0
 * - Complete the "drive" method which simulates the driving of the automobile
 * for a given distance by reducing the gasoline according to the efficiency
 * - Complete method "getGasInTank" to get the amount of gas in the tank
 * - Complete method "addGas" which adds fuel to the tank
 * <p>
 * See AutomobileTester for details on how the class is used
 * <p>
 * Difficulty: Easy
