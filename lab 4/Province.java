/**
 * This class represents a province with a name, population, and area. For this
 * problem, you should complete the following:
 * <p>
 * - Create a constructor that initializes the name, population, and area
 * according to given parameter values
 * - Complete the "getProvinceStats" method which returns a string with the
 * province's stats as specified
 * - Complete the "getPopulationDensity" method which returns the population
 * density
 * - Complete the "compareDensity" method which compares the density of another
 * province to this province and returns an integer value as specified
 * <p>
 * This class is tested by ProvinceTester.java, which will also help you further
 * understand the method definitions.
