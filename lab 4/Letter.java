 * - Create an addLine method which takes in a String and appends it to the end of the ArrayList holding the letter
 * - Create a getText method which returns a String which has all the text in the letter
 * - Create a getNumberOfLines method which returns the number of lines currently in the letter
 * - Create a removeLine method which removes the line in the letter with the given index (note that indexing starts with 1 for the input)
