/**
 * A cash register totals up sales of several items purchased by a customer, totals up the payment made,
 * and computes change due.
 * In this class, you should complete the following tasks:
 * <p>
 * - Implement "recordPurchase" which adds the given item price to the current total
 * - Implement "enterPayment" which takes in a given number of Coin objects, and updates the current
 * total paymennt made.
 * - Implement "giveChange" which calculates the amount of change to be returned after payment
 * <p>
 * This class is uses Coin.java and is tested in CashRegisterTester.java
