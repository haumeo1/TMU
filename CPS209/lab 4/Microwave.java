/**
 * This class represents a microwave oven. It stores a timer as an integer and
 * a string indicating whether the power is high or low. For this problem, you
 * should complete the following:
 * <p>
 * - Complete the constructor to initialize the timer to 0 and the power level
 * to low
 * - Complete the "increaseTime" method to increase the time on the timer by
 * 30 seconds
 * - Complete the "switchPower" method to switch between low and high power, or
 * vice versa
 * - Complete the "reset" method which resets the timer to 0 and power level to
 * low
 * <p>
 * This class is tested by MicrowaveTester.java, which will also help you further
 * understand the method definitions.
