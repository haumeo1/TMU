/**
 * A FillInQuestion is a type of question where the responder has to fill in the
 * blanks. You should complete the constructor for this question.
 *
 * An object of this class is constructed with
 * a string that contains the question and the answer.
 * The answer is marked by underscores at the start and end,
 * for example:
 *
 * "The inventor of Java was _James Gosling_".
 *
 * The question should be displayed as
 *
 * The inventor of Java was _______________.
 *
 * Note the number of underscores in the question is
 * 2 plus the length of the answer string, in this case,
 * 2 + 13 = 15.
 *
 * You should complete the following tasks:
 *
 * - Complete the constructor
